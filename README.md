# Taxi_Demand_Forecasting_Using_Time_Series
The following project is concerned with proposing a methodology for forecasting taxi demand. This project employs a comprehensive comparative analysis of various time series models (the Seasonal Naive model, Seasonal Additive model, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, Prophet model, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model) to accurately forecast the demand of taxi trips at various times of the day. An additional aspect introduced into the scope was to look into how factors such as holidays can substantially impact the demand. The project highlights the impact of irregular components in the form of holidays, and appropriately incorporates the same to enhance the predictive capability. The findings indicate that the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model performed best overall. The outstanding capability of the FBProphet model in adapting to holiday effects is highlighted, along with the potential of employing neural networks through Long Short Term Memory.
